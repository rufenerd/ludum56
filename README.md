# Goobers: Escape from Lab 8

Lead the Goobers (a mysterious species of tiny creatures) in a daring escape from a sinister laboratory. The goobers must scavenge for food while breeding to create new types with different abilities. Balance risk and reward as you guide your goobers to freedom.

Each day, a random group of goobers is randomly drawn from your population and it’s up to you to assign them to adventure for food, advance your escape, or reproduce. Experiment with different combinations of goober types to create new species with unique abilities—key to your success. But don’t forget, you’ll lose if you don’t have enough food to sustain your entire population each day. Adventure all the way through the lab to find the exit and win.
